This is my first portfolio project on Covid infections across the world.
I used SQL and Tableau for the fist time in this project.
Based on the results, I noticed smaller countries tend to have a higher rate of covid infections across their population.
I might dig into this hypothesis in the future. It might be a good correlation analysis project between covid infection and area of a countries.
